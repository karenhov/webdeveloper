    <h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
    <p>
       <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,<mark>“and what is the use of a book,”</mark>thought Alice <strong>“without pictures or conversations?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>So she was considering</u> in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her <s>feel very sleepy and stupid</s>), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
